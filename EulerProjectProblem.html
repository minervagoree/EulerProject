    <!--The Project Euler can be found at http://projecteuler.net 
		I'm solving the first three problems as requirements to completeing the  Odin Project which is training to become a software developer with training in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby with the framework Ruby on Rails.  

		All the projects are submitted to my github account at http://github.com/minervagoree by using git bash to commit new documents and commit changes for version control.

			<p>Multiples of 3 and 5</p>
			<p>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

				var number = 1000;
				var x = 0;

				for (var i = 0; i < number; i++) {
					var j = i;

			<h2><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=2">Euler's Project Problem 2:</a></h2>
			<p>Even Fibonacci numbers</p>
			<p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
				1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
			</p>
			<p>By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
			</p>	
			<script language="JavaScript">
				var total = 1000;
				var first = 0;
				var second = 1;
				var next
				var add =0;

				for (var i = 1; i < total; i++) {

					next = first + second;
					first = second;
					second = next;

					if( next <4000000 && next%2 === 0) {
						add = add + next;
						  
					}
					

				};
				document.write("The sum of the even-valued terms up to 4 million is " + add);
